            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>This is an extended, revised version of <a href="ds-paper-558.html#philipson-2017"> </a>. Findability
                and interoperability of some PIDs and their compliance with the FAIR data principles
                are explored, where ARKs were added in this version. It is suggested that the wide
                distribution and <em>findability</em> (e.g. by simple 'googling') on the internet
                may be as important for the usefulness of PIDs, as the <em>resolvability</em> of PID
                URIs. This version also includes new reasoning about the failure to use PIDs such as
                DOIs for citation. The prevalence of phenomena such as <em>link rot</em> implies
                that the persistence of URIs cannot be trusted. By contrast, the well distributed,
                but seldom directly resolvable ISBN identifier has proved remarkably resilient, with
                far-reaching persistence, inherent structural meaning and good
                    <em>validatability</em>, by means of fixed string-length, pattern-recognition,
                restricted character set and check digit. Examples of regular expressions used for
                validation of PIDs are supplied or referenced. The suggestion to add
                    <em>context</em> and meaning to PIDs, making them "identify themselves", through
                namespace prefixes and object types is more elaborate in this version. Meaning can
                also be conferred by means of structural elements, such as well defined, restricted
                string patterns, that at the same time make PIDs more "validatable". Concluding this
                version is a generic, refined model for a PID with these properties, in which
                namespaces are instrumental as custodians, meaning-givers and validation schema
                providers. A draft example of a Schematron schema for validation of "new" PIDs in
                accordance with the proposed model is provided.</p>

            <h1>Introduction: Identifiers in science</h1>
            <p>Identifiers in science may refer to digital or physical objects, or concepts.
                <!-- Added in response to Review 1: --> They may also refer to persons, researchers,
                as ORCiD IDs <a href="ds-paper-558.html#haak_etal-2012"> </a>, or to research organizations, as the
                recently launched RORs <a href="ds-paper-558.html#ROR-2019"> </a>. This paper will focus on
                persistent identifiers, PIDs, for research <em>outputs</em>, 'things' such as
                articles, datasets, samples, concepts etc. But, as suggested in section 7, ORCiDs or
                RORs may be an optional part of a modular, integrated identifier for research
                outputs.<!-- end response to Review 1 --> PIDs may be general or domain-specific.
                Among the more prevalent general PID-types are ARK, DOI, Handle and UUID. There are
                also old, bibliographic identifiers like ISBN. Created in the 1960's and -70's of
                the print era, how come they survived into this digital age? Some reasons might be:
                they are well distributed across the internet, and widely used by stake-holders
                (libraries, publishers, readers). They have a semantic structure, identifying
                well-defined objects, and a fairly precise validation mechanism through fixed
                string-lengths, limited character-set and check digits. Some of these properties of
                good identifiers are shared by ARKs, DOIs, Handles and UUIDs, or other more domain
                specific identifiers used for scholarly data, but seldom all of them simultaneously.
                The focus here is on findability and 'validatability' of PIDs of different
                types.</p>

        <section id="sec_identifiers">
            <h1>Identifiers - why do we need them?</h1>

            <p>The general purpose of identifiers is to serve as <em>references</em> to the objects
                that they are supposed to identify. This requires identifiers to indicate,
                preferably in and by themselves, what <em>type of objects</em> they are meant to
                identify. Far from all identifiers fulfil this requirement. It is often left to the
                    <em>names</em> of things to <em>describe</em> the objects identified, providing
                context and <em>meaning</em>. <!-- new content following: --> Context may be added
                by means of location within an hierarchical system, e.g. as in Linnéan taxonomy,
                where scientific names situate a species within a genus, sometimes also containing
                the provenance of that name, serving to disambiguate beween names of species
                belonging to widely different genera, e.g. <em>Asterina gibbosa</em> Gaillard 1897
                (a fungus), and <em>Asterina gibbosa</em>(Pennant, 1777) (an echinoderm, a
                starfish). For the same purpose, it also happens that 'things', objects are renamed
                later, as with the preceding fungus species now having the accepted scientific name
                    <em>Asterolibertia gibbosa (Gaillard) Hansf. 1949</em> and / or are assigned an
                identifier:
                    <em>urn:lsid:catalogueoflife.org:taxon:02af8238-ac8f-11e3-805d-020044200006:col20150401</em>.<a
                    href="ds-paper-558.html#col-2015"> </a>. However, even if a PID may well serve the need for
                disambiguation by uniquely identifying an object, it may still be no better -
                sometimes, as in this case, perhaps even worse at giving access to said object, or
                at least a landing page with metadata about it. The identifier assigned above is
                neither directly resolvable nor 'googlable', while the scientific name is at least
                easily findable via a search engine.<!-- end new content --></p>
            <p>While scientific <em>names</em> are often useful for <em>describing</em> objects,
                they have other drawbacks compared to PIDs, some of which were identified by <a
                    href="ds-paper-558.html#patterson-2016"> </a>. For example, homonymy and disambiguation should be
                no problem for globally unique identifiers. And while concatenations or
                abbreviations may be problematic in the use of names for identification,
                string-length and pattern restrictions are useful for validation of identifiers.
                Missing or added characters, all types of misspellings are easier to detect and
                validate in standardized identifiers of fixed string-length or well-defined
                character patterns. Inconsistent encoding should also not be a problem in good PIDs,
                with limited character sets. However, these assets of some identifiers may conflict
                with the interest in having also transparent, meaningful PIDs that at least in part
                "speak for themselves". The result of a compromise between these two interests may
                be seen in the <em>Handle</em> system (below).</p>

            <h1>FAIR principles</h1>
            <p>The FAIR guiding principles aim <q>to make (meta)data <strong>Findable, Accessible,
                        Interoperable, and Re-usable</strong>.</q><a href="ds-paper-558.html#fair-2016a"> </a> As
                such they concern also PIDs, as is seen from some of the principles:</p>

            <figure id="fairpic">


                <p><img class="14cm-9cm" src="https://datasciencehub.net/system/files/img/fairforce11pic.jpg"

            </figure>

            <p>The FAIR principles clearly need interpretation to become fully operational, and such
                work is also well in progress. <a href="ds-paper-558.html#doorn-2017"></a>
                <a href="ds-paper-558.html#dunning-2017"> </a>
                <a href="ds-paper-558.html#wilkinson_etal2018"> </a> Further explications of some of the principles
                are also available in <a href="ds-paper-558.html#fair-2016b"> </a>. Figuring prominently in the
                explications of all these principles, particularly for <em>interoperability</em>, is
                the requirement that metadata should be machine actionable, <q>a <em>conditio sine
                    qua non</em> for FAIRness.</q>] <a href="ds-paper-558.html#force11-2016"> </a> This is also used by <em>fairmetrics.org</em> as a measure of
                Findability.<a href="ds-paper-558.html#FM_F2"> </a>
            </p>


            <p>However, the FAIR principles do not say anything <em>explicitly</em> about
                    <em>validation</em>. Particularly for the principles of
                    <em>Interoperability</em> and <em>Re-usability</em>, it is crucial that metadata
                can be properly validated against a schema, as adhering to an accepted metadata
                standard. <!-- Response to Metareview: -->It has been remarked that this is already
                implied by the FAIR principle R1.3 above, but if so, only indirectly and still open
                to interpretation. There are several cases where general data repositories,
                professing to be FAIR and adhere to accepted metadata standards both for their
                default output and export formats, nevertheless fail to validate against schemas of
                these same standards.<a href="ds-paper-558.html#philipson-2019"> </a>
                <em>Fairmetrics.org</em>
                <a href="ds-paper-558.html#wilkinson_etal2018"> </a> explicates R1.3, as measuring a "Certification
                from a recognized body, of the resource meeting community standards", by means of a
                valid electronic signature, such as a verisign signature.<a href="ds-paper-558.html#FM_R1-3"> </a>
                However, one might ask whether general data repositories such as <a
                    href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu">Harvar'ds Dataverse</a>,<a
                    href="https://figshare.com">Figshare</a> or <a href="https://zenodo.org"
                    >Zenodo</a>, qualify as "recognized bodies" in this respect, all being part of
                the test reported in "Evaluation_Of_Metrics/Supplementary Information_ FM Evaluation
                Results.pdf" <a href="ds-paper-558.html#wilkinson_etal2018"> </a>, but none of which could be
                evaluated on R1.3. This comes as no surprise, since there is already a comment on
                R1.3 saying that "Such certification services may not exist, but this principle
                serves to encourage the community to create both the standard(s) and the
                verification services for those standards."<a href="ds-paper-558.html#FM_R1-3"> </a> True, in the
                rationale for FM_R1.3 there is mention of validation: "... As such, data should be
                (individually) certified as being compliant, likely through some automated process
                (e.g. submitting the data to the community's online validation service)".<a
                    href="ds-paper-558.html#FM_R1-3"> </a> But it remains unclear what the "community" here refers to
                a general metadata standard, or a repository, using it's own standard and validation
                service? Some output metadata files from repositories even lack a
                    <em>schemaLocation</em> reference, making it difficult to validate them, or, the
                schemaLocation given might be erroneous, as observed in one case.<a
                    href="ds-paper-558.html#philipson-2019"> </a> We cannot just wait for repositories themselves to
                provide verification of compliance with standards. We must use available validation
                tools, testing to what extent they are keeping their promises of compliance
                compliance. <!-- /end review response. --> This concerns metadata in general, but
                naturally includes also identifiers. We must be sure that they are of the type or
                format they claim to be, even if they cannot be resolved to a dedicated
                landing-page. Failed validation, e.g. due to simple typos or wrong namespace, may
                even be one way of checking why an identifier or URI does not resolve as expected.
                Validation is also important for the possibility to export metadata to another
                format, thereby promoting the re-use of data, without exporting also potential
                errors. <!-- New content: -->Resistance to transcription errors, e.g. by means of a
                restricted character set, using base32 for encoding, and fixed string-length (suffix
                has 2 times 4 characters, separated by a hyphen), has been promoted as an advantage
                of so-called "cool DOIs".<a href="ds-paper-558.html#fenner-2016"> </a> These are precisely the kind
                of properties that make PIDs eminently "validatable" and thereby
                    <em>machine-actionable</em>, a crucial requirement for FAIRness.
                <!-- end new content --> Although transformation or harvesting of metadata might be
                possible even without validation, trust in the results and quality as well as the
                eventual findability of the data (and so again the re-usability) might be seriously
                affected. For enhanced findability, it is also important that standard, widely
                distributed identifiers are used.</p>

            <p>Validation of an identifier means ensuring that it is true to its proclaimed type,
                for example, making sure that what is flagged as an ISBN is not in fact an ISSN
                (real use case), or that the string-length and check-sum is compliant with its type.
                An advantage of promptly validatable identifiers is that validation can often be
                performed also off-line, by means of <!-- added: --> a pattern expressed by a
                regular expression, a piece of script (JavaScript, Python, etc.), an HTML
                form,<!-- end added --> or a schema (e.g. XSD or Schematron) and a piece of software
                such as an XML-editor.</p>

                <a href="ds-paper-558.html#dunning-2017"> </a> The argument here is not that resolvable, persistent
                URIs should be avoided as identifiers; most often they serve their purpose of more

                has been eloquently remarked, "persistent URIs must be used to be persistent".<a

                    resource’s location changes over time. ... The solution comes at a price because
                    it requires operating a resolver infrastructure and maintaining the look-up

            <p>This is true of ARKs, DOIs, as well as Handles, PURLs and URNs. There are in fact
                numerous cases when the lookup-table is not maintained and updated as required. That
                is why it may be wise not to rely on a single 'custodian' for the resolution of
                identifiers and access to associated metadata. <!-- Added content: --> Note that we
                are not talking here about simply having more than one proxy server acting as
                resolvers of the same PIDs. We already have that; provided the lookup-table is
                managed properly, the three different DOI-URIs from three different proxy-servers

                principles, since three of their references that actually have DOIs are cited

                or other PIDs assigned, documents are often not cited by those PIDs. One possible
                reason might be that the PID is not clearly displayed in the landing page with
                metadata, or in the document itself. In the case of <a href="ds-paper-558.html#duerr-2011"> </a>
                above it takes an extra click on a link 'Cite as' to actually have the DOI

                more verbose and complex, than it would have been to just copy-paste from the 'Cite

                > </a>, the founding paper of the FAIR principles, where you either have to download
                the citation with the DOI from the landing page, where it is not displayed, or find
                it at the bottom of each page in the actual paper, but not prominently marked. This
                may partly explain why a recent paper on software sustainability and
                reproducibility, while arguing that one of the ways to make software more
                reproducible is to "use a persistent identifier such as a Digital Object Identifier
                (DOI) to help find and cite code" <a href="ds-paper-558.html#cruz_etal-2018"> </a>, failed itself to
                use the DOI when citing <a href="ds-paper-558.html#wilkinson-2016"> </a>. Another reason, gathered
                from one of the authors by personal communication, but which I believe could be
                generalized, is that inclusion of the DOI (or other PID) was not part of the
                citation style of the publisher. In fact, it sometimes happens that publishers
                impose their own citation formats or standards, excluding the use of PIDs.
                <!-- End new content. --> Again, PIDs must be <em>used</em> and cited to persist.
                Citations help in achieving wide distribution, depending on good 'validatability',
                in order not to multiply errors and 'non-resolution' as a result.</p>

            <!--     <p>One way to achieve wider distribution of identifiers might be by means of
                    <em>signposting.org</em> (see also: <a href="#vandesompel-2016b"> </a>) 
                typed links with relation type "cite-as" in HTTP link headers for the preferred PID
                HTTP URI replacing the simple URL.<a href="#signpostId-2017"> </a>, <a
                    href="#vandesompel-2018"> </a> However, the signposting initiative, so far, only
                seems to redirect the question of use from PIDs and DOIs to HTTP header links. And,
                ironically, none of the <em>signposting</em> founding documents <a
                    href="#signpostId-2017"> </a>, <a href="#vandesompel-2018"> </a> referenced
                above seem to have PIDs or HTTP header links referring to such. Possibly, because
                these are still evolving documents or webpages, that might not be considered fit yet
                for being asigned identifiers meant to be persistent. But, that is true of many,
                perhaps most web-pages, leaving out perhaps the largest part of the internet from
                being accessed by means of PIDs. At the same time there are initiatives to make it
                easier to assign DOIs also to digital material that otherwise might be regarded as
                "ephemeral", such as blogposts.<a href="#fenner-2016"> </a>
            </p> -->
            <p>Again, going back to the question of resolvability, the relationship between
                identifiers such as DOIs and URIs/IRIs is not always straightforward, and sometimes
                involves a chain of redirects ('303s'), before reaching a destination holding also
                the appropriate metadata.<a href="ds-paper-558.html#wass-2016"> </a><a href="ds-paper-558.html#wass-2017"> </a>.
                Another reason resolvability may not be sufficient, even if the metadata is somehow
                in place, is that the file on the destination page resolved to is behind a paywall.
                In a case from December 2016, public domain content more than 110 years old was
                hidden behind a DOI-resolver charging 50$ for release of the content.</p>

            <p>When someone in an ensuing Twitter conversation complained about this, an answering
                tweet seemed to mean, that was the price we have to pay for something as useful as
                DOIs. There was also a remark to the effect that every object gets one and only one
                DOI. But this is not necessarily true. It is possible to mint several DOIs for the
                same resource by different agents, such as Dataverse, Figshare, Zenodo etc. If not,
                that would give commercial publishers the opportunity to pro-actively seize whatever
                public domain content there is out there on the internet, quickly mint and assign
                their DOI to it and then lock it up behind paywalls. In any event, it would
                certainly not promote the use of PIDs instead of simple, ephemeral URLs for
                citation.</p>

            <p>The DOI in question then was: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00222930908692639"
                    >10.1080/00222930908692639</a>. The remedy proposed to "jump over" the
                paywall was by means of what was then <em>oadoi.org</em> <a href="ds-paper-558.html#hayes-2016"
                > </a>, which still worked quite well. In several steps it eventually led, via an
                API, to an XML-file with a link to the freely accessible fulltext at <a
                    href="http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/60220"
                    >http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/60220</a>. However, things have
                changed. When tried again in November 2018, the replacement <em>unpaywall.org</em>
                <a href="ds-paper-558.html#hayes-2017"> </a> and oadoi-API for <a
                    href="https://api.oadoi.org/v2/10.1080/00222930908692639?email=j@s"
                    >10.1080/00222930908692639</a> was not working anymore for this DOI; the
                response received was: <code>best_oa_location: null</code>. But the resource sought,
                free from paywall, although no longer detected by <em>unpaywall.org</em>, could
                still be found e.g. at <a
                    href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/71907#page/71/mode/1up"
                    >biodiversitylibrary.org</a>. However, often you will not find a free
                replacement copy of paywalled resources. An earlier "error message" (December, 2016)
                from <em>oadoi.org</em> for <a href="ds-paper-558.html#paskin-1999"> </a>, said this holds for around
                80% of scholarly articles.<!-- New content added:--> Maybe the situation has changed
                for the better since then. In January 2018, the unpaywall.org FAQ-page<a
                    href="ds-paper-558.html#unpaywallFAQ-2018"> </a> stated: <q>We find fulltext for 50-85% of
                    articles, depending on their topic and year of publication.</q> But, this
                message is no longer found there (in November 2018). And as we have seen in the
                example above, apparently in some cases <em>unpaywall.org</em> no longer finds open
                access fulltext alternatives, that was previously found by the <em>oadoi.org</em>
                application used then.</p>



            <p>If <em>unpaywall.org</em> or an oadoi-API (e.g. <a
                    href="https://api.oadoi.org/10.3897/biss.2.25805?email=p@x"
                    >https://api.oadoi.org/10.3897/biss.2.25805?email=p@x</a> - the 'email' argument
                as given here may well be "fake", as long as it holds the @-character) fails to find
                a freely accessible publication (as with <a
                    href="https://api.oadoi.org/10.1007%2Fs10654-018-0449-x?email=n@y"
                    >https://api.oadoi.org/10.1007%2Fs10654-018-0449-x?email=n@y</a>), an
                alternative might be to try the <a href="http://identifiers.org/services/sparql"
                    >identifiers.org SPARQL endpoint</a> .<a href="ds-paper-558.html#wimalaratne-2015"> </a> But, it
                does not necessarily give us an open access URI in return. And it only works if the
                potential corresponding URIs have been assigned the property <em>owl:sameAs</em>
                just as the submitted subject URI. Unfortunately, in neither of our cases above
                these conditions are met.</p>

            <p>Assuming we have finally found a single seemingly reliable custodian of our PIDs and
                URIs, promising 24/7 resolution and top quality metadata, should we rest content
                with that? Most serious lawyers and journalists probably would agree: it is wise not
                to judge by the testimony of a single witness, a single source alone. The evidence
                of at least two, mutually independent witnesses is generally preferred. <em>Multiple
                    resolution</em> of any PID by several different proxy servers, as we already
                know, still means single parenthood, single custodianship of that lookup-table that
                has to be managed and updated in order for the PID to resolve as expected. Clark
                describes it as representing a stage in the evolution of PIDs, that will eventually
                be surpassed by a more mature age when we supply also <em>data types</em> to come
                with the PIDs, in order to make them more machine actionable <a href="ds-paper-558.html#clark-2016"
                > </a>. But we want more than that. We want backup custodians, relatives or friends
                as caretakers when the poor single parent fails duty. Providing multiple
                    <em>access</em> to, or <em>identification</em> of resources through PIDs, that
                are capable of serving as trustworthy, competent, valid independent witnesses from
                different moments in time, at different sites, in different places is a good idea.
                Thus, we accept <q>that an object may have multiple PIDs</q>. Ideally these multiple
                PIDs should get to "know about" each other as a way towards interoperability.<a
                    href="ds-paper-558.html#clark-2016"> </a> This can be achieved already, e.g. by means of linked
                open data (LOD), sameAs-relationships and tools provided by <em>n2t.net</em>,
                    <em>unpaywall.org</em> and the <em>identifiers.org</em> SPARQL endpoint referred
                to above. Multiple identifiers from different namespaces for the same object may
                even be desirable in order to ensure interoperability in different environments.<a
                    href="ds-paper-558.html#paskin-1999"> </a>. It is also in line with the principle of the semantic
                web known as the <em>NUNA, Non-Unique Naming Assumption</em>, implying that
                    <q>things described in RDF data can have more than one name</q> and any object
                may be identified by more than one URI, serving in RDF as 'names' of things.<a
                    href="ds-paper-558.html#coyle-2014"> </a></p>
            <p>However, this does not imply that any identifier, any PID is as good as the other. In
                fact, there are significant differences in quality between identifiers, particularly
                in terms of 'validatability' and 'meaningfulness'. We are
                getting there a bit later.</p>

            <p>But first, having referred to linked data and sameAs-relationships as a possible
                solution to achieving interoperability, what about long-term sustainability? Are
                LOD, relying heavily on URIs, fit for survival? Archival records for long-term
                preservation need to be self-sustained, carrying meaning within themselves, while
                the references may no longer be resolvable. In e-archives compliant with the
                OAIS-model and Trustworthy Digital Repositories standards for self-sustenance, this
                means that URIs lacking an inherently meaningful structure will often serve only as
                another set of dumb identifiers. Unless they can import some meaning from outside,
                through resolution or sameAs links, such opaque, non-resolvable URIs should
                henceforth rather be described as "non-semantic".</p>

        <section id="which_identifiers">
            <h1>Which identifiers are FAIR enough?</h1>

            <p>We must ask about PIDs, <q>Persistent Identifiers</q>, just how <q>persistent</q>
                they are really? Even if not always resolvable, are they in general still
                'findable', well distributed over the internet in time and space? Are they
                'validatable' (e.g. through fixed string-length, pattern-recognition, restricted
                character set, built-in checksum, built-in type?) Are they FAIR?</p>

            <p><strong>Findability:</strong> Beginning with the F for findability, for comparison we
                go back in time to 'old-fashioned' ISBNs, Internaional Standard Book Numbers.
                Publicly declaring what type of objects they are meant to identify, ISBNs are rarely
                directly resolvable. But they are widely distributed, they have good
                    <em>findability</em> in terms of <em>precision</em> hits, as seen by simple
                'googling', with good survival rate, longer than the median age of web-pages 9.3
                years. For example, look at ISBN 0-14-029161-X: <em>The Diversity of Life / Edward
                    O. Wilson (2001)</em>. Simple googling of 014029161X, unprefixed and without
                hyphens results in 57/57 precision hits (date: 2017-01-30). ISBNs could also be
                searched in library catalogs, the most comprehensive of which is probably the <a
                    href="https://kvk.bibliothek.kit.edu/">Karlsruhe Virtual Catalog – KVK
                    worldwide</a>. Result of the query '014029161X', with the same unprefixed ISBN
                without hyphens yields 123/123 precision hits, recall being difficult to compute
                since in 55 of 72 catalogs the search could not be successfully processed or no
                records were found. To counteract the possibly unfair bias with a modern classic
                like this, we try instead an even older, and presumably less well-known example:
                ISBN: 2130381030. <em>L'Identité : séminaire interdisciplinaire dirigé par Claude
                    Lévi-Strauss, 1974-1975</em> (Paris: PUF, 1983). Googling without prefix
                (2130381030) the precision is between 14/39 and 22/50; with prefix (ISBN2130381030)
                it reaches as high as 17/18 (date: 2017-01-30).</p>

            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Data and (digital) objects are accessible only in so
                far as identifiers are findable or resolvable preferably to open access landing
                pages with either direct availability of resources, or sufficient metadata to direct
                the user to such an access point. In this respect DOIs are often, but not always, as
                good as or sometimes better than ISBNs (for obvious reasons regarding print only
                material), while gni-UUIDs as described above are all but useless. </p>

            <p><strong>Interoperability</strong> and <strong>Re-usability</strong> are both
                intimately associated with 'validatability', as argued above. We will look more into
                detail at the performance of different PIDs regarding this below.</p>

            <p><strong>Archival Resource Key (ARK) Identifiers:</strong> ARKs have a well defined
                syntax <a href="ds-paper-558.html#ARK-2018"> </a>:
                    <code>[http://NMA/]ark:/NAAN/Name[Qualifier]</code> , where <em>NMA</em> is a
                (changeable) <em>Name Mapping Authority</em>, a "host" or proxy resolving agent.
                This is not part of the ARK proper, as marked out by the encompassing brackets. The
                    <em>NAAN</em> is the <em>Name Assigning Authority Number</em>, corresponding to
                the prefix starting with '10.dddd' in a DOI, and serving as a namespace for the
                following /Name. The NMA-supported <em>[Qualifier]</em> is not further defined in <a
                    href="ds-paper-558.html#ARK-2018"> </a>, but an example is given by the suffix
                    <em>s3/f8.05v.tiff</em>, including also a file extension as we can see. As
                examples below, none of them having a qualifier, we find ARKs giving direct access
                to digital fulltext of Buffon’s <em>Histoire naturelle</em> at BnF and a 20th
                Century Guide for mixing fancy drinks in Internet Archive, here with
                    <em>identifiers.org</em> as resolving NMA. In the third case, we see a resource
                with a prominent feature of ARKs, their possible <em>inflections</em>, here
                represented by the two '??' at the end of the URI, giving both metadata for the
                'document' itself, a photo of the Dallas Police Department from 1963, and the name
                and location of the collection holding it. This inflection property of ARKs might
                serve as a response to the requirement ensuing from the FAIR principle of
                accessibility (A2), that "metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer
                available" <a href="ds-paper-558.html#fair-2016a"> </a>, i.e. resources that have for some reason
                been removed from the net should at least leave a gravestone with metadata of last
                known whereabouts behind to the afterworld. Another interesting, perhaps
                unintentional feature of this particular case is that when the resolving agent, the
                NMA is changed from <em>texashistory.unt.edu</em> to either <em>identifiers.org</em>
                or <em>n2t.net</em>, the very same ARK does not resolve to the same landing page,
                the same location. </p>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>What about the "validatability" of ARKs, then? As obvious already from the examples
                above, apart from the specific structure, there is no specific pattern or definite
                string-length of an ARK. The only restrictions on the Name and Qualifier parts "as
                strings of visible ASCII characters" is that they "should be less than 128 bytes in
                length" using "letters, digits, or any of these six [Sic!] characters: = # * + @ _
                $", allowing also four more characters with reserved meaning: % - . /<a
                    href="ds-paper-558.html#ARKspec-2008"> </a> These general restrictions are hardly sufficient for
                efficient validation by means of a regular expression. It is possible to impose
                restrictions defining a specific pattern and string-length within a namespace, for a
                particular NAAN, using for example a NOID template <a href="ds-paper-558.html#kunze-2006"> </a>, but
                this is not something that is required by the ARK specification.</p>

            <p>More heavily incumbent on an ARK seems to be the demand that, "[i]f longevity is the
                goal, it is important to keep the prefixes free of recognizable semantics"<a
                    href="ds-paper-558.html#ARKspec-2008"> </a>. This, I believe, is a misconception. It is not the
                absence of semantic content that guarantees longevity; it is rather the continued
                    <em>use</em> of the identifier that enhances its persistence, as observed again
                by <a href="ds-paper-558.html#vandesompel-2016a"> </a> above, and this use may well be promoted by at
                least some semantic content in the identifier, allowing a user to recognize it as an
                identifier of precisely that particular object that it is supposed to identify. The
                    <em>Findability</em> by simple 'googling' and current <em>Accessibility</em> of
                the example ARKs above presently (Nov. 2018) still seems quite good. At least the
                first of these three examples seems to be well distributed, producing an impressive
                precision score of 25/25 by simple googling of '12148/bpt6k97497t' (each page in the
                hitlist actually containing a reference to the same document by Buffon in the
                Gallica collection). The second example apparently has a narrower distribution, but
                the few items found still display good precision, 4/4. The third example, without
                inflection, has been used extensively as a paradigmatic case, so should perhaps be
                considered outside competition here, but anyway also shows good precision. And,
                given the limited <em>validatability</em>, the degree to which the resources they
                identify will also be <em>Interoperable</em> and <em>Re-usable</em> will very much
                depend on the difficult to predict long-term sustainability of these two first FAIR
                properties of these ARKS.</p>

            <p><strong>DOI:</strong> DOIs can look just like anything. Here are some real cases, all
                at the time of writing resolvable and with multiple Findability also by simple
                googling, some of them pretty 'old', although they got their DOIs assigned fairly
                recently. One is even from 1977 (doi: 10.1177/030631277700700112), but it still
                produces an impressive precision score of 68/68 (date: 2018-11-07), mostly due to it
                quite high citation rate, yielding hits for all the citing sources.</p>

            <p>Now, following are two old DOIs from Wiley Online Library 1996 and Springer 2001 that
                still do not seem to resolve properly (neither on 2017-01-31, nor on
                2018-11-11):</p>
            <ul>

                            >10.1002/(SICI)1520-6297(199601/02)12:1&lt;67::AID-AGR6&gt;3.3.CO;2-#</a></p>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, the two following old DOIs, again from Wiley Online 1996 and 1998, that were
                similarly unresolvable at the same date (2017-01-31), are proof that some PIDs might
                regain there resolvability later. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><a
                            href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6297(199601/02)12:1&lt;105::AID-AGR10&gt;3.3.CO;2-K"

                <li>
                    <p><a
                            href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6297(199811/12)14:6&lt;475::AID-AGR5&gt;3.3.CO;2-6"

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Obviously, all these DOIs, whether resolvable or not, vary substantially in
                string-length, from just 17 to over 60 characters, some involving abbreviations of
                journals or organisations, one an ISBN, and some containing characters in need of
                special XML-encoding, different from URI. Note that although the two last items in
                the first group are from the same journal, <em>Scientometrics</em>, they are quite
                different in structure. Anyway, all the above DOI examples are <em>valid</em> in
                accordance with the best we can offer as a regular expression restriction, with only
                partial pattern recognition: <code>^10[.][0-9]{4,}\/\S+$</code>
            </p>
            <p>meaning that any valid DOI must start by '10.' followed by a minimum of 4 digits,
                before the slash '/' and then a suffix of any length or characters, but no spaces in
                between.</p>


            <!-- Extended as response to Reviewer 4 - comment 5), making use also of reference to identifiers.org/MIRIAM from Metareview: -->
            <p>But then, according to the same partial restriction, <em>defined by the regex
                    above</em>, this entirely fake DOI is equally valid:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><code>10.99999999/xxxxxxxx/x(y)x\:-{=?%%@@@@@ </code></p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>To be sure, there are other regular expression restrictions suggested for DOIs, those
                that are even more permissive (as DataCite 4.1, with the pattern value for doiType
                set to "10\..+/.+" <a href="ds-paper-558.html#datacite4-2017"> </a>, apart from not being PHP or
                JavaScript compliant, allowing also inline spaces, or the pattern registered for
                DOIs at <em>identifiers.org</em> as "^(doi\:)?\d{2}\.\d{4}.*$" <a
                    href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam/main/collections/MIR:00000019"
                    >MIR:00000019</a>, both of which also allow for the fake DOI above as valid,
                when tested in <a href="https://regex101.com/">regex101.com</a>).
                <!-- /end extended response --> There are other patterns that are more restrictive,
                but then obviously not catching all the now prevalent and permitted DOIs by one
                singular regular expression. <a href="ds-paper-558.html#fenner-2016"> </a>, <a href="ds-paper-558.html#gilmartin-2015"
                > </a> Thus, unlike ISBNs, DOIs are difficult to validate properly. Or rather, it is
                hard to find sufficiently discriminatory criteria to distinguish proper DOIs from
                fake ones. They have no fixed string-length, and very little of character set
                restrictions. All we can have is a partial pattern recognition; the more restrictive
                the validation rule or regular expression it is based on, the more actually existing
                DOIs it will leave out.</p>

            <p><strong>Handle:</strong> The Handle identifier system, of which DOIs are only a
                special case, seems fairly easy and handy at first glance. It comes in two different
                flavors. One is the semantically opaque, which has the structure:
                    <em>Prefix/noid</em> (10079/sqv9sf1), where the NOID-part (for Nice Opaque
                Identifier <a href="ds-paper-558.html#kunze-2006"> </a>) is a short alphanumeric string from the
                restricted character set "0123456789bcdfghjkmnpqrstvwxz", with random minting
                    order.<a href="ds-paper-558.html#guo-2016"> </a> The other flavor is the semantically
                transparent, which could be of three different types: the URL handle:
                    <em>Prefix/local-PID</em>
                <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/10079/bibid/123456">(10079/bibid/123456)</a> , the
                user handle: <em>Prefix/netid/netid</em>
                <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/10079/netid/guoxinji">(10079/netid/guoxinji)</a>,
                which as demonstrated here seems to be less persistent, as people tend to move, and
                the simpler group handle: <em>Prefix/group</em>
                <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/10079/ISPS">(10079/ISPS)</a>. While those of the
                second flavor might be more instantly "meaningful", providing context, how are
                Handles fairing regading Findability and Accessibility? The findability by googling
                will again, as for other PIDs, largely depend on the use and citation rate of items,
                while the accessibility again rests largely on the maintenance of the lookup-table
                by the custodian. Even so, as just demonstrated, Handles may not always resolve to
                the page expected, especially when used as context dependent identifiers of
                individuals. In these cases, ORCiD ids should be preferred. What about the
                Interoperability and Re-usability of Handles then? Those of the NOID type, with a
                restricted character set, will in principle at least be effectively "validatable",
                to the extent that the "namespace" or minting agent restricts the string-length, as
                e.g. <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/2077/36687">2077/36687</a> – Gothenburg
                university: 4/5 characters, and <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/10079/31zcrtn"
                    >10079/31zcrtn</a> – Yale university: 5/7 characters. Those of the second,
                "semantic" flavor will apparently prove less "validatable" in the sense that there
                is no longer any fixed string-length or restricted character-set.</p>

            <p><strong>UUID:</strong> UUIDs v5 are used within the field of biodiversity taxonomy,
                as a complement to scientific names.<a href="ds-paper-558.html#patterson-2016"> </a> They were
                introduced to the field in 2015 by the Global Names Architecture - GNA <a
                    href="ds-paper-558.html#gna-2015"> </a>. The arguments for using them instead of name strings for
                certain functions are that they save space as index keys in databases, they have a
                fixed string length (36 characters, including the dashes) while scientific names are
                of different length. UUIDs do not suffer, as names sometimes do, from encoding
                problems that are difficult to detect and they are more easily distinguishable one
                from the other than name strings for closely related species variants. Specifically,
                it is argued that <q>UUIDs v5 ... can be generated independently by anybody and
                    still be the same to the same name string... Same ID can be generated in any
                    popular language following well-defined algorithm.</q><a href="ds-paper-558.html#gna-2015"> </a>
                Note, however, that it is actually the specific <em>name</em> string that is
                identified here, not the object, the organism, the 'thing itself'. Thus, the
                resulting UUID is completely dependent upon the particular name string (with its
                encoding), it cannot be used as a bridge between different name forms for the same
                organism, telling us that they are naming the same object. This is due to the fact
                that it is <q>generated by hashing a namespace identifier and name</q>.<a
                    href="ds-paper-558.html#UUID-2017"> </a> As a result, UUIDs generated in this way by the gna name
                resolver, e.g. "707f84e1-e5b8-5063-8256-369ba9d72e13" for <em>Antiaris
                    toxicaria</em> are next to useless as instruments of Findability, often yielding
                0 hits by simple googling, all the while a search on the scientific <em>name</em>
                alone will give plenty of precision hits for the sought after organism, providing
                rich metadata for the 'thing' itself. Likewise, the same UUID is seldom or never
                Accessible, by being resolvable on its own. As an example, consider one of the most
                well studied organisms of all, the fruitfly <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>. Using
                the Global Names Resolver <a href="ds-paper-558.html#gna-2015b"> </a> to get a UUID v. 5 for
                    <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>,
                &lt;gni-uuid&gt;1bc2f359-47e4-5da6-a748-74676b7c8c5d&lt;/gni-uuid&gt;, googling it
                either unprefixed or prefixed gives a zero result (0 recall, 0 precision, date:
                2017-01-30). Trying instead the same UUID in a general search of all databases of
                NCBI, the US National Center for Biotechnology Information), we get 0 hits
                (2018-11-15): <a
                    href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gquery/?term=1bc2f359-47e4-5da6-a748-74676b7c8c5d"
                    >1bc2f359-47e4-5da6-a748-74676b7c8c5d</a>. Most notably, we get 0 hits in the <a
                    href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/?term=1bc2f359-47e4-5da6-a748-74676b7c8c5d"
                    > NCBI Taxonomy database</a>, that on the face of it would seem to be the most
                relevant to our search.</p>

            <p>By contrast, the UUID v5 is eminently "validatable", with a character set restricted
                to digits and lower case [a-f], and a fixed string length, 36 characters including
                hyphens, in a recognizable, precise pattern: "8-4-4-4-12", allowing for validation
                by a regular expression such as
                    <code>^[a-f\d]{8}-[a-f\d]{4}-[a-f\d]{4}-[a-f\d]{4}-[a-f\d]{12}?$</code>, or by
                means of an <a href="http://www.freecodeformat.com/validate-uuid-guid.php"> online
                    validator</a>. On the other hand, given the fact that these generated UUIDs are
                seldom or ever used for citation, and are not "fed back" to the source databases,
                where the corresponding scientfic names were found, it is doubtful whether this
                "validatability" is also sufficient to make them qualify for
                    <em>Interoperability</em> and <em>Re-usability.</em> To improve its findability
                and re-usability the UUIDs v5 issued by the Global Name Resolver could "ping-back"
                and assign themselves to the records in the biodiversity database sources they were
                drawn from and further use <em>schema.org</em> markup to get incoming links and a
                better ranking by search engines.</p>

        <section id="sec_why_context">
            <h1> Why context?</h1>

            <p>Generally speaking, although it is preferable that identifiers be findable and
                identifiable also in their unprefixed, pure form, typed identifiers give context by
                means of namespace prefixes of a metadata standard, a vocabulary or ontology. A
                typed identifier "intoduces itself", telling us what kind of identifier it is, and
                what type of objects it is used for. Most importantly the namespace tells us what
                schema(s), which rules should be used for its validation.</p>

            <p> Page <a href="ds-paper-558.html#page-2016"> </a> claimed that e.g. "dc:title" is adding "unnecessary
                complexity (why do we need to know that it's a "dc" title?)" in the JSON
                expression:</p>
            <pre><code> { "@context": { "dc:title": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/title" },
                "dc:title": "Darwin Core: An Evolving Community-Developed Biodiversity Data
                Standard" }</code></pre>

            <p>A simple answer is that namespaces are important to retain meaning from context,
                serving as a key to interpretation for the future. Self-sustained long-term
                preservation should ideally mean in a case like this that the dc specification and
                schemas valid at the time be archived together with the records,<a
                    href="ds-paper-558.html#li_sugimoto-2014"> </a> or at least that there is provenance metadata
                including timestamps and namespace of terms used. Metadatafiles in XML usually have
                a xsi:schemaLocation indicating which schema to validate against. This information,
                together with timestamped metadata elements such as 'dateIssued' should be
                sufficient to provide context. For JSON metadata there are name/value pairs such as
                    <code>{ "protocol": "doi", ... "createTime": "2017-01-12T10:49:03Z", ...}</code>
                that could fill the same function. And then, context is just as important for
                validation of records also in the present.</p>

        <section id="sec_newPID">
            <h1>A "new" contextual, integrated, validatable PID?</h1>

            <p>As seen in the case of Handle above, validatability sometimes comes at a cost:
                transparency lost. Are we forced to make a choice between the two? Can we create
                identifiers that are both fully validatable and at the same time more meaningful,
                providing context? So, here we suggest a <em>model</em> for a "new" PID, with a
                limited character set, at least for the object id part, defined by namespace
                specifications and schemas. </p>
            <pre><code><em>Model</em>: [namespacePrefix].[objectType].[objectId: 10 positions].[issuedDate: YYYY-MM-DD].[registrant: ORCID or ROR-ID]
                </code></pre>

            <pre><code><em>Example (expression of this paper)</em>: fabio.PositionPaper.pp1255qv43.2018-11-12.0000-0001-5699-994X</code></pre>


            <p> It is a model of a structured, contextual, modular, validatable identifier. To make
                it easier to implement, and more generalizable, there is no character set or
                string-length restrictions for the first two modules, except that they should not
                contain the dot (.), which is reserved as a module separator. Nevertheless, this
                means already existing namespaces and object types could already be used to create a
                PID in accordance with this model.</p>

            <p>The third module, the objectId (local ID) has a limited character set, selected to
                avoid ambiguous interpretations and, to avoid making local uniqueness case-dependent
                    <a href="ds-paper-558.html#mcmurry_etal-2017"> </a>, restricted to lower case letter characters
                and digits. The full stop or dot (.) was chosen as module separator, since it works
                well in both xml- and http-environments, without encoding, and is not subject to
                confusion as sometimes hyphens and dashes (en-dash and em-dash) can be. It also
                works for tokenization of strings. The object type identified in the second module
                should belong to the initial namespace prefix. Every namespace can have as many
                object types as needed. Namespace schemas could also define valid <em>data
                    types</em> for their different object types, thus supplying PIDs with <em>data
                    types</em>, in order to make them even more machine actionable.<a
                    href="ds-paper-558.html#clark-2016"> </a></p>

            <p> The scalability of this model will mainly depend on the 10 character objectId and
                the size of the permitted character set. An objectId limited to the proposed
                character set [a-kmnp-z0-9] will have 34<sup>10</sup> permutations within each
                namespace (and possibly objectType), still better than e.g. a 7 character Handle
                with NOID.</p>
            <p>The objectId module, thus, could be validated separately by a regular expression
                restricted to <code>^[a-kmnp-z0-9]{10}$</code>. It may also be part of a more
                comprehensive validation schema, involving a random or pattern based minting
                algorithm, preferably including a checksum, with different rules invoked for
                different namespace contexts, checking also for example the correspondence between
                namespace (module 1) and objectType (module 2) as in this still crude Schematron
                schema:</p>
            <pre><code>
                
&lt;schema xmlns="http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron"  queryBinding="xslt2"&gt;  
  &lt;ns prefix="rdf" uri="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"/&gt;
  &lt;ns prefix="fabio" uri="https://w3id.org/spar/fabio"/&gt;
  &lt;ns prefix="local" uri="local"/&gt;
  
 &lt;pattern&gt;
  &lt;rule id="newPid-rule" context="local:newPid"&gt;  
   &lt;let name="objectType" value="for $i in (.) return tokenize($i,'\.')[2]"/&gt;
   &lt;let name="objectId" value="for $i in (.) return tokenize($i,'\.')[3]"/&gt;
   &lt;let name="x" value="'https://w3id.org/spar/fabio'"/&gt;
   &lt;let name="objectTypeList" value="(for $i in  (doc($x)//rdf:type[@rdf:resource='http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Class']/parent::rdf:Description/@rdf:about) 
   return substring-after($i,'fabio/'))"/&gt;
   &lt;let name="objectTypeString" value="string-join($objectTypeList,',')"/&gt;
   &lt;assert test="matches($objectId,'^[a-kmnp-z0-9]{10}$')"&gt;
   An identifier of type 'newPid' must have as its third module a namespace unique objectId of 10 characters from the set [a-kmnp-z0-9].&lt;/assert&gt;
   &lt;assert test="matches($objectTypeString,$objectType)"&gt;The objectType, the second module of the newPid must belong to the namespace of the first module.
   &lt;/assert&gt;  
  &lt;/rule&gt;
 &lt;/pattern&gt;
&lt;schema&gt; 
            </code></pre>

            <p> One might consider generalizing such a validation schema to the extent possible, so
                that the namespace URI in $objectTypeList, from which the $objectType should be
                drawn, was automatically construed based on the namespace prefix (module 1) of the
                newPid instance to be validated. This could be achieved by having the
                namespacePrefix (module 1) expressed as a link with namespace URI, e.g. as <a
                    href="https://w3id.org/spar/fabio.xml">fabio</a> in our case above. But that
                would also make the validation schema a bit more complicated, notably the
                tokenization and separation of modules.</p>

            <p> It is also conceivable, to allow for integration of already existing identifier
                schemes, that a namespace sets its own character set and string-length restrictions,
                to be declared by the validation rules of that namespace. For "narrow" namespaces,
                lacking defined different object types, possibly since they comprise basically only
                one type of object (as for e.g. ISBNs and ISSNs) we suggest as default second module
                value <em>'NOT'</em> = No Object Type. So we could have an IGSN, <em>International
                    Geo Sample Number</em>
                <a href="ds-paper-558.html#SESAR-2017"> </a>, with string-length of objectID set to 9, expressed in
                this model:</p>

            <pre><code><em>Example</em>: IGSN.NOT.IECUR0002.2005-03-31.gswa-library</code> 
            </pre>

            <p>The identifier should be fully validatable, as a whole or in part (modules), in the
                corresponding namespace(s). The last two modules are optional, but they are meant to
                offer built in data provenance. For organisation identifiers, we hope that the
                recently launched ROR-IDs will become a global standard, like the ORCID for persons.
                Then we could replace the last module in the IGSN-PID above with "05h2dda38". </p>

            <p>The resulting PIDs should be minted within the corresponding namespaces, who would
                also be the 'custodians' and resolving authorities of their PIDs, responsible for
                their uniqueness within their namespace. Another task would be to monitor and assign
                sameAs-properties to PIDs that refer to the same 'thing' in other
                namespaces.</p>

            <p>It has been suggested that in order <q>to build more connected, cross-linked and
                    digitially accessible Internet content</q> it is necessary <q>to assign
                    recognizable, persistent, globally unique, stable identifiers to ... data
                    objects.</q><a href="ds-paper-558.html#guralnick-2015"> </a>. The model proposed here aims to
                make "new" PIDs fully recognizable, universally unique, stable, but always in a
                well-known context, meaningful, and with a good potential for backup.</p>

        <section id="conclusions">
            <h1>Conclusions</h1>
            <p>The purpose of this paper was to analyse some of the more prevalent general PIDs used
                in scholarly communication, identify some of their shortcomings and find out how
                PIDs could be made more FAIR. Real examples of PIDs were analysed to find out what
                additional requirements there might be to make them fully Findable, Accessible,
                Interoperable and Re-usable - FAIR. The "novelty" of the paper, if any, is then the
                "widening" of the FAIR principles to include also Findability as rate of
                distribution or dissemination (e.g. as measured by means of 'googling') and
                Interoperability or Re-usability to include also 'validatability'. Further, as
                against earlier insistence on the opaqueness of PIDs as a warrant for persistence,
                we argued for the importance of adding meaning to PIDs, through
                namespace prefixes and object types, as possibly enhancing their future use,
                distribution, findability and interpretability and safeguarding against failed
                resolvability. The custodianship and minting of PIDs, we suggested to be the
                responsibility of namespaces, as these are already assuming
                the administration of specifications, validation schemas, vocabularies or
                ontologies, and should be well qualified for the task. The minting algorithm, the
                patterns for PID-recognition, restriction in character set, string-length (with
                possible checksum) of objectId module should all
                be part of the validation schemas. These namespaces should then be able to register
                their schemes with <em>n2t.net</em> or <em>identifiers.org</em>, as already happens.
                And there might be several services such as the SPARQL endpoint of
                    <em>identifiers.org</em> for registering sameAs-links. To create, maintain and
                make our PIDs truly persistent, widely used and FAIR should be a cooperative effort 
                of the whole scholarly community.</p>
