Title: Application of Concepts of Neighbours to Knowledge Graph Completion
Author: Sébastien Ferré
Tracking #: 622-1602

I kindly thank the reviewers for their careful reading, and their
valuable suggestions for improvement.

The parts of the paper that have been added or significantly changed
are shown in bold in the supplementary file of the new manuscript.

I hereafter answer to each point raised by the reviewers by describing
the changes that have been made.

# Approach name

True. Given that this name has already been used in former
publications, it is difficult to make a radical change. We replaced
CNN by C-NN, which has a nice analogy with k-NN for the classical
nearest neighbour approach.


# The big picture

> example per se. What would help is a big picture explaining how the

Thank you for the suggestion of "a big picture", we agree that this
was missing. We added a short section "Overview of the Approach",
before the technical sections, supported by a new figure showing the
whole workflow of the approach in a schematic way. The new section
summarizes the whole approach along with a small running example, and
with references to the relevant sections. We hope that it will
facilitate the reading of the paper.

A pseudocode algorithm (Algorithm 2) was added to explain the
inference and ranking process.


# Formal terminology

We strived to simplify and clarify the technical sections. In
particular, in Section "Concepts of Nearest Neighbours", we added
before each formal definition a short paragraph to provide context and
intuition about what is defined and why.

We also significantly simplified the very definition of C-NNs
(Definition 3). Table 1 has been changed accordingly.


# Scalability

We added the following paragraph in the introduction:

«The combinatorial aspect of graph patterns over knowledge graphs is
tackled by delaying their computation to inference time, which enables
to bound the number of C-NNs by the number of entities, and in
practice it is generally much smaller. The intensive knowledge-based
computation at inference time is managed with in-memory KG indices (as
is common in RDF stores), and an any-time algorithm for both C-NN
computation and inference.»

And the following paragraph at the end of the section on C-NNs computation:

«A last point to discuss is the scalability of C-NNs
  computation w.r.t. the KG size, i.e. what is the impact of doubling
  the number of entities. If we make the reasonable assumption that
  the new knowledge follows the same schema as the old knowledge
  (e.g., adding film descriptions to a film KG), then the impacts are
  that: a) the query answers are two times larger, and b) the number
  of C-NNs is somewhere between the same and the double, depending on
  the novelty of the new knowledge. As a consequence, if our objective
  is to compute a constant number of C-NNs for further inference, then
  it suffices to increase timeout linearly with KG size.»


# Explainability

This is discussed along with the description of Algorithm 2, in the
new subsection 6.3.
