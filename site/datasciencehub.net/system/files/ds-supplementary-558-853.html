                <li>
                    <p><strong>Reviewer</strong>: <q>While the author treats content IDs in some
                            amount of depth, there are three mentions of ORCID iDs that are not
                            referenced in any way. This may be confusing to readers not well-aware
                            of the persistent identifier community and this reviewer suggests that a
                            short explanation be added at the first mention (Section 5) and a
                            reference to a paper added. Also, in the Model in Section 7, ORCID
                            should be spelled with an "O" not a "0". I would suggest the author
                            consider ether specifying that the paper is about persistent identifiers
                            for content ("things") OR to add a section on identifiers for persons
                            and organizations (for which there is currently a very brief
                        aside).</q></p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Reasons to reject</strong>: <q>I think there isn't a strong enough
                            connection between the overall argument (do identifiers adhere to FAIR
                            guidelines?) and the examples and data presented. The paper argues
                            against opaque identifiers, but doesn’t directly tackle commonly
                            accepted reasons to keep identifiers opaque (for example: persistent
                            identifiers need to remain the same over time and the metadata used to
                            describe the item being identified may change; non-opaque identifiers
                            may lead users to assume details about potential identifiers). There is
                            some discussion in the paper about the shortcomings of identifiers, but
                            it’s unclear how having a non-opaque identifier would help with this.
                            The issues described (Open access content vs. paywalled content) are not
                            related directly to the identifier string, but to the implementation of
                            the identifier. It would be useful to expand on this as well and perhaps
                            focus on how identifiers will be more discoverable and persistent if
                            their names reflect what they are - will this really make the
                            identifiers themselves more 'findable'? How much of this proposed
                            infrastructure change depends on Google indexing the correct piece of
                            metadata?</q></p>

                    <p><strong>Response</strong>: I believe the onus is on those advocating opaque
                        PIDs to show somehow that they are also more persistent than PIDs with some
                        sort of semantic content. The argument put forward here is rather based on
                        the observation that it is the continued <em>use</em> of PIDs that makes
                        them persistent,<a href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#vandesompel-2016a"> </a> with the possible
                        implication, based on the case of ISBNs, that an inherent semantic structure
                        will potentially enhance the chances of continued use. Admittedly, there is
                        no conclusive proof of this assumption in the paper, but even so, the
                        semantic content proposed here (in section 7) as part of the modular,
                        contextual new PIDs comes primarily from the namespace prefixes and the
                        associated object types, making these PIDs at least easier to
                            <em>interpret</em> also in the future, even if or when they are no
                        longer resolvable.(PIDs are part of metadata, and as has been observed, the
                        challenge for long-term preservation of metadata is to keep them
                        consistently and correctly interpretable over time.<a
                            href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#li_sugimoto-2014"> </a> Although, the original example given in
                        the model for a "new" PID in section 7 did appear to have some semantic
                        content even in the objectId module, this is by no means a necessary
                        condition, so I have changed the example accordingly to avoid giving that
                        impression. A valid reason, rather than an as yet unproven enhanced
                        persistence, for having at least the objectId opaque, might be to facilitate
                        automated minting of locally unique strings. (The objectId module does not
                        have to be globally unique, only unique within that namespace and / or
                        possibly the objectType. That is, it is rather a <em>Local ID</em> in the
                        anatomy of a web-based identifier, described by <a href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#mcmurry_etal-2017"
                        > </a> So, resembling the ISBNs in this respect, you might have a simple
                        minting algorithm built on some sort of numerus currens within namespace and
                        / or objectType, possibly reserving certain character combinations for
                        certain object types.) The case with the now paywalled public domain
                        content, more than 110 years old, seized by a commercial publisher who is
                        demanding 50 USD for 24 hours access, and hidden behind an opaque DOI, for
                        which <em>unpaywall.org</em> is now unable to find an alternative open
                        access version, although known to exist, I believe, does illustrate a
                        possible disadvantage with completely opaque identifiers. Especially when
                        paired with the false belief (ignoring the NUNA - the Non-Unique Naming
                        Assumption of the semantic web), that there can or should be one and only
                        one PID, such as a DOI, for the same content. This false assumption,
                        encountered again from curators at natural history museums at TDWG2018 in
                        Dunedin, will continue to "give commercial publishers the opportunity to
                        pro-actively seize whatever public domain content there is out there on the
                        internet, quickly mint and assign their DOI to it and then lock it up behind
                        paywalls ...it would certainly not promote the use of PIDs instead of
                        simple, ephemeral URLs for citation." And so, it would negatively affect the
                        findability of documents or other digital objects. There is, I believe, an
                        intimate relationship between accessibility and findability in this respect.
                        Ideally, I think commercial agents should be blocked from using common
                        namespaces to assign PIDs to content that is in the public domain, and then
                        locking it up behind a paywall. They should be forced to create their own
                        namespaces for this kind of piracy, and these namespaces could then be put
                        on a public blacklist, possibly maintained by <em>unpaywall.org</em>.</p>

                            semantics to an identifier is a good solution. What we should have is a

                    <p>Extended review: <q>I do not believe including extensive semantics in the
                            identifiers is a good idea. We are trying to move away from this even
                            though it is very difficult. I would like to see a common service model
                            to retrieving metadata about identifiers. The paper also proposes a
                            model but there is no technical solution behind this model to find out
                            how difficult or easy to generate or maintain such a semantically rich
                            identifier. The paper does not describe which community is interested in
                            taking up such a semantically rich identifier scheme. </q></p>

                    <p><strong>Response</strong>: This review somehow begs the question, by relying
                        on the problematic "resolvability" of PIDs, or how else should the semantics
                        of a given identifier be retrieved? For the objection about the difficulty
                        in generating and maintaining a "semantically rich" PID, see in part the
                        response above to Review 2, noting in particular that the semantic content
                        in the proposed model comes primarily from the namespace prefixes and object
                        types. With the further observations that ISBNs have been able to preserve a
                        semantic structure, throughout their lifetime, and with the namespace
                        custodians as designated maintainers and creators minting these "new" PIDs,
                        this author finds it hard to understand why this model should be any more
                        difficult to implement and maintain than the present.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Reasons to reject</strong>: <q>There are a number of serious
                            inconsistencies within the manuscript that raise significant questions

                            <p>"The author states that “The prevalence of phenomena such as link rot
                                implies that the persistence of URIs cannot be trusted.” The
                                persistence of URIs is independent of link rot – just as the
                                existence of an ISBN or DOI doesn’t guarantee that the book/paper is
                                available. For digital identifiers, this is resolved through the use
                                of tombstone pages."</p>

                            <p>"The authors state that “another reason resolvability may not be
                                sufficient, even if the metadata is somehow in place, is that the
                                file on the destination page resolved to is behind a paywall. In a
                                case from December 2016, public domain content more than 110 years
                                old was hidden behind a DOI-resolver charging 50$ for release of the
                                content.” PIDs do not guarantee open access and shouldn't. In
                                addition to potential costs of material (as noted above) there are
                                many cases where content identified by a PID should not be available
                                without access restrictions (e.g. Protected Health Information). For
                                the examples given in the manuscript, the PIDs described in the
                                manuscript do provide metadata for the resources identified. The
                                authors continue to discuss this further “However, things have
                                changed since then. When tried again now (Nov. 2018), the
                                replacement unpaywall.org [22] and oadoi-API for
                                10.1080/00222930908692639 is actually not working anymore for this
                                DOI; the response we get is: best_oa_location: null. But the
                                resource sought, free from paywall, although no longer detected by
                                unpaywall.org, can still be found at biodiversitylibrary.org, at
                                several different URLs.” PIDs are needed to identify open content
                                and content that has various restrictions (and not only restrictions
                                due to cost). PIDs should not be a guarantee of open access to
                                underlying content – however all PIDs should have appropriate
                                metadata (see 3 below)."</p>

                            <p>"The authors state that “Again, going back to the question of
                                resolvability, the relationship between identifiers such as DOIs and
                                URIs/IRIs is not always straightforward, and sometimes involves a
                                chain of redirects ('303s'), before reaching eventually a
                                destination holding also the appropriate metadata.” However, that is
                                not the case as the metadata for any DOI is easily available:

                            <p>"The authors contend that “Providing multiple access to, or
                                identification of resources through PIDs, that are capable of
                                serving as trustworthy, competent, valid independent witnesses from
                                different moments in time, at different sites, in different places
                                is a good idea. Thus, we accept “that an object may have multiple
                                PIDs”. Ideally these multiple PIDs should get to "know about" each
                                other as a way towards interoperability.” This explosion in
                                identifiers potentially poses significant problems. A primary issue
                                would be the systems required to keep the synonyms in check – the
                                overall ecosystem would need another PID-like service that maintains
                                this information. In addition, there already exist independent and
                                trustworthy resources that resolve PIDs. For example, for DOIs the
                                resources dx.DOI, n2t.net and identifiers.org (and others) all
                                resolve metadata for DOIs."</p>

                            <p>"The authors state that “according to the same partial restriction,
                                this entirely fake DOI is equally valid:
                                10.99999999/xxxxxxxx/x(y)x\:-{=?%%@@@@@“ However, this is incorrect.
                                The initial component of the DOI (10.99999999) is organization that
                                controls the ID space and this is not a valid DOI prefix."</p>

                            <p>"The authors state that “UUIDs generated in this way by the gna name
                                resolver, e.g. "707f84e1-e5b8-5063-8256-369ba9d72e13" for Antiaris
                                toxicaria are next to useless as instruments of Findability, often
                                yielding 0 hits by simple googling, all the while a search on the
                                scientific name alone will give plenty of precision hits for the
                                sought after organism, providing rich metadata for the 'thing'
                                itself.” First this is not the issue with the PID itself - rather
                                its utilization. There are many PIDs that have very good findability
                                via Google as their use entails incorporation in the text of
                                documents (e.g. database accession numbers from PDB or GEO, the use
                                of RRIDs in methods sections). In addition, googling for names does
                                not always produce proper results – a primary reason for the
                                increased interest in the use of ORCIDs to enable author
                                disambiguation."</p>

                            <p>Model suggested is not differentiated from current models</p>
                            <p>"The authors propose a model for PIDS: “Model:
                                [namespacePrefix].[objectType].[objectId: 10 positions].[issuedDate:
                                YYYY-MM-DD].[registrant: org.id/ORCID] Example (expression of this
                                paper):
                                fabio.PositionPaper.jPsaveXD17.2018-11-12.0000-0001-5699-994X”
                                However, this model is very similar to current handles. It seems
                                that the two pieces that determine the “prefix” that is who created
                                it and for what purpose are split. In the proposed model. However,
                                this would be similar to allowing anyone to create a handle with
                                derived prefixes which is allowed by the handle infrastructure: “The
                                GHR is a distributed registry whose operation is managed
                                collaboratively by the DONA Foundation and multiple organizations
                                that are credentialed and authorized by DONA. Each of those
                                credentialed organizations are referred to as MPAs (or Multi-Primary
                                Administrators). A credential is a number, made known to the GHR by
                                DONA and allotted to a given MPA. MPAs, in turn, are authorized to
                                allot derived prefixes from their credential to themselves and to
                                third parties. The MPA and these third parties can provide
                                identifier and resolution services (aka local handle services) for
                                handles under the derived prefixes allotted to them. The GHR
                                specifically communicates to the client, upon request, the location
                                and certain relevant security information of the local handle
                                services that can process the handle that the client is interested
                                in resolving.” The authors also discuss that the “resulting PIDs
                                should be minted within the corresponding namespaces, who would also
                                be the 'custodians' and resolving authorities of their PIDs,
                                responsible for their uniqueness within their namespace. Another
                                task would be to monitor and assign sameAs-properties to PIDs that
                                refer to the same 'thing' in other namespaces.” Would this then
                                result in a collection of un-coordinated custodians? This is an
                                issue with database accession numbers and has required construction
                                of additional infrastructure to support the resolution of these
                                PIDs. Coordination and management of the sameAs-properties cold
                                become problematic as well and isn’t discussed."</p>

                            <p>I am not sure I understand this objection. Link rot does sometimes
                                prevent using a URI for direct identification of an object, and that
                                is precisely what identifiers are for. There are not always
                                "tombstone pages" available, and even when there are, as in the
                                cases referred to in objection 3, for <a
                                    href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199510)46:9&lt;646::AID-ASI2&gt;3.0.CO;2-1"

                                available" as being referred to directly from the destination page
                                of the DOI-URI, where you are only met by the message "DOI Not
                                Found" or "Page not found". This means at least that the PID-URI in
                                these cases cannot be considered to be properly machine-actionable,
                                a pre-requisite for FAIRness; unless you implement an automatic
                                redirect in your workflow for these cases, you have to make a new
                                manual search using the Crossref search-API
                                    <em>https://search.crossref.org/?q=</em>, something that may not
                                be obvious to everyone using PIDs (including this author, who is
                                thankful to the Reviewer for this piece of information). Of course,
                                you could say that the PID-URIs are still persistent, while the
                                links are not, but that is a mere play with words. The purpose of a
                                URI = Uniform Resource Identifier, is to identify an object, an
                                entity, and if the link does not work any longer, it simply fails
                                duty. It is for this very reason that the paper argues for PIDs that
                                are well distributed over the Internet, 'googlable' and not
                                dependent on one single link-URI, one single custodian or "parent"
                                to fulfil their mission. It is in this respect that ISBNs serve as
                                an example, not because you will always find a copy of the actual
                                book that they identify - it may be on loan at your local library or
                                out of print, not in store, but because you will most often be able
                                to identify the object that they are supposed to identify, through
                                many online library catalogs, bookstores, reference lists, net
                                resources etc.</p>

                                Accessibility, and I do not think it should be the purpose of PIDs
                                to make content that belongs in the public domain in fact <em>less
                                    accessible</em>, as in the case referred to here. For the rest,

                                point 4, they all lean on as their main reference <a
                                    href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#clark-2016"> </a>, a presentation by Jonathan Clark,
                                representing the International DOI Foundation, at the first
                                PIDapalooza in Reykjavik 2016. So, again, this does not represent a
                                major invention by this author. And if you read further from there,
                                you will also find a reference, again, to the NUNA, the Non-unique
                                Naming Assumption. Maybe this is is not enough to dissipate the fear
                                of an "identifier explosion", that I believe already happened, but I
                                do agree that we need more agents, not only one central PID-like
                                service to "keep synonyms in check", and we need it already today.
                                The paper refers to the SPARQL endpoint of <em>identifiers.org</em>
                                <a href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#wimalaratne-2015"> </a> as one such important agent, but
                                this should be a common responsibility of all those namespace
                                custodians who want to mint PIDs of their own, thus to contribute to
                                the FAIR effort of making PIDs, as an essential part of metadata,
                                    <em>Re-usable</em> also in the sense that they are "sufficiently
                                well-described and rich that it can be automatically (or with
                                minimal human effort) linked or integrated, like-with-like, with

                                avoid minting new PIDs for the same 'things' in vain, when there are
                                already sufficiently well-known, well described, 'validatable' PIDs
                                in widespread use for the same objects.</p>

                            <p>Again, the impression is received that the reviewer has not read the
                                paper under review sufficiently carefully to see that "the same
                                partial restriction" here naturally refers back to the preceding
                                regex above (to make this evident it is spelled out in the revised
                                version of the paper submitted with this response to reviews). And
                                the restriction by this regex fully matches with this fake DOI, no
                                matter what the prefix rules for DOIs say, as shown below. </p>

                            <p>Furthermore, unfortunately, the same goes for the even less
                                restrictive rules for DOI validation used by DataCite "10\..+/.+" <a
                                    href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#datacite4-2017"> </a>, or the pattern registered for DOIs
                                at identifiers.org as "^(doi\:)?\d{2}\.\d{4}.*$" <a
                                    href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam/main/collections/MIR:00000019"
                                    >MIR:00000019</a>, both of which also allow for the fake DOI
                                above as valid, when tested in <a href="https://regex101.com/"
                                    >regex101.com</a>. It is of course possible to construct a more
                                restrictive regex that rules out false DOI prefixes, and thus would
                                have this fake DOI fail to validate, but that obviously remains to
                                be implemented yet in validation schemas used by important agents
                                such as DataCite and identifiers.org. And, as is further argued in
                                the paper, given the quite lax initial rules for DOI structure, once
                                you try to be more restrictive, you obviously will not catch all the
                                now prevalent and permitted DOIs by one singular regular expression.
                                    <a href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#fenner-2016"> </a>, <a href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#gilmartin-2015"> </a>
                                So, as is stated in the paper, "the more restrictive the validation
                                rule or regular expression it is based on, the more actually
                                existing DOIs it will leave out."</p>

                            <p> One reason for the uselessness of the UUIDs issued by the gna name
                                resolver as an instrument of Findability for the organism, the
                                'thing itself' is clearly stated in the paper in the sentences just
                                preceding the one quoted by the reviewer: "Note, however, that it is
                                actually the specific <em>name</em> string that is identified here,
                                not the object, the organism, the 'thing itself'. Thus, the
                                resulting UUID is completely dependent upon the particular name
                                string (with its encoding), it cannot be used as a bridge between
                                different name forms for the same organism, telling us that they are
                                naming the same object. This is due to the fact that it is
                                    <q>generated by hashing a namespace identifier and name</q>.<a
                                    href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#UUID-2017"> </a>" This is what the <em><q>in this
                                    way</q></em> in the sentence quoted (in part) by the reviewer
                                refers to. But I agree that the uselessness of the UUIDs in this
                                respect is at least partly due also to it's not being further
                                utilized for citations or disseminated to other databases, while
                                suspecting this fact is closely related to the preceding way in
                                which they are created as hashes of <em>name</em> strings, rather
                                than as identifiers of objects, concepts, 'things'. The point I am
                                trying to make, with reference again to <a href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#vandesompel-2016a"
                                > </a> is that PIDs must be used to be persistent, and that the
                                chances of becoming used and utilized for identification are better
                                if the PID by it's own structure, revealing some semantic content,
                                somehow reflects what kind of 'thing' it is supposed to identify. In
                                this sense, I believe a quite long, totally opaque string, such as
                                the UUID-5, that on the face of it appears to be more or less random
                                (although in reality there is a strict hashing algorithm behind it),
                                might possibly be less successful in this respect. I know there are
                                other databases, with identifiers, often shorter, such as accession
                                numbers, that are more successful in this respect, e.g. UniProt,
                                whose PIDs are also resolved by identifiers.org, but then only if
                                you use the right namespace prefix, e.g.
                                http://identifiers.org/UNIPROT:P68512, which already tells you
                                something about what kind of 'thing' you are supposed to identify,
                                i.e. having some semantic content. One might add that databases such
                                as UniProt are known to have made an extra effort to be findable by
                                'googling' through the use of schema.org markup. This is something
                                that should be encouraged in all PID-custodians or producers, as a
                                way of disseminating and enhancing the use of these PIDs! Naturally,
                                'googling' is not the only solution to enhanced findability, and
                                certainly googling for names does not always produce good results.
                                In particular, in section 2 of the paper it is argued that "While
                                scientific names are often useful for describing objects, they have
                                other drawbacks compared to PIDs, some of which were identified by
                                    <a href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#patterson-2016"> </a> . For example, homonymy and
                                disambiguation should generally be a lesser problem for globally
                                unique identifiers." So, this remark about ORCIDs seems a little bit
                                misplaced or at least redundant here. Please note also, that it is
                                for a reason, i.e. precisely the awareness of the sometimes dubious
                                results of 'googling', that the estimated precision rates were
                                included in some of the examples given in the paper. (Recall rate,
                                unfortunately, is harder, perhaps even impossible, to estimate in
                                these cases.) </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>This objection is also a bit difficult to understand. First, the
                                paper makes no specific claim of originality in this respect. That
                                is why in the beginning of section 7 the word <em>model</em> is
                                emphasized and there are quotation marks surrounding "new" (now in
                                the revised version also in the section heading, to make it
                                clearer): <q>So, here we finally suggest a <em>model</em> for a
                                    "new" PID, with a limited character set, at least for the object
                                    id part, defined by namespace specifications and schemas.</q>
                                The "mission" of the paper is simply to explore the concept of a
                                PID, looking at real examples, their positive and negative features,
                                and find out what additional requirements there might be to make
                                them fully findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable - FAIR.
                                The "novelty" of the paper, if any, would then rather be the
                                "widening" of the FAIR principles to include also Findability as
                                rate of distribution or dissemination (measured by means of
                                'googling') and Interoperability or Re-usability to include also
                                'validatability'. As for the custodianship and minting of PIDs, the
                                model proposed is that this should be the responsibility of the
                                namespaces to which they belong. I do not see why these, already
                                assuming the administration of specifications, validation schemas,
                                vocabularies or ontologies, should be any less qualified for this
                                task, than the MPAs in the Handle system. The minting algorithm, the
                                patterns for PID-recognition, restriction in character set,
                                string-length (with possible checksum) of objectId module should all
                                be part of the validation schema. These namespaces should then be
                                able to register their schemes with <em>n2t.net</em> or
                                    <em>identifiers.org</em>, as already happens. So, why should the
                                danger of "a collection of un-coordinated custodians" be any more
                                real than today? Besides, PIDs are meant to work on a
                                    <em>network</em>, essentially by means of links between nodes in
                                the network. Have we not come further beyond the idea of a central
                                authority ruling everything? Possibly many different actors and
                                namespace custodians could contribute to creating "sameAs" links
                                between PIDs identifying the same 'things'. And there might be
                                several services such as the SPARQL endpoint of
                                    <em>identifiers.org</em> for registering such links. </p>

                            R1.3), the FAIR principles require (meta)data to meet domain-relevant

                    <p><strong>Response</strong>: I do insist that "the FAIR principles do not say

                        principle R1.3 , it is only indirectly so and in reality open to
                        interpretation. There are several cases where general data repositories,

                        standards both for their default output and export formats, still fail to
                        validate against schemas of these same standards. <a href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#philipson-2019"

                            >Zenodo</a>, qualify as "recognized bodies" in this respect, all being
                        part of the test reported in "Evaluation_Of_Metrics/Supplementary

                        but none of which could be evaluated on this measure R1.3. This comes as no
                        surprise, since there is already a comment in <em>fairmetrics.org</em>
                        <a href="https://purl.org/fair-metrics/FM_R1.3">FM_R1.3</a> saying that
                        "Such certification services may not exist, but this principle serves to
                        encourage the community to create both the standard(s) and the verification

                        automated process (e.g. submitting the data to the community's online
                        validation service)".<a href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#FM_R1-3"> </a> But it remains unclear if the
                        "community" referred to here is defined by a certain general metadata
                        standard, or by a repository, using it's own standard and validation
                        service. Some output metadata files from repositories even lack a
                            <em>schemaLocation</em> reference, making it difficult to validate them,
                        or, the schemaLocation given might be erroneous, as observed in one case. <a

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Reviewer</strong>: <q>You refer to identifiers validation and
                            patterns for identifier types. These patterns is something maintained at
                            identifiers.org (see e.g.
                            https://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam/main/collections/MIR:00000110). Have you
                            considered that? </q></p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Response</strong>: Well, yes now I have, but it does not change
                        anything, except that for ARKS, the pattern deposited there,
                        ^(ark\:)/*[0-9A-Za-z]+(?:/[\w/.=*+@\$-]*)?(?:\?.*)?$, is a little bit more
                        restrictive than the <em>arkspec.txt</em><a href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#ARKspec-2008"> </a>, by
                        excluding the character '#' from the allowed set. Otherwise, it only
                        confirms the view expressed in the paper that <q>... apart from the specific
                            structure, there is no specific pattern or definite string-length of an
                            ARK. The only restrictions on the Name and Qualifier parts "as strings
                            of visible ASCII characters" is that they "should be less than 128 bytes
                            in length" ...</q>. This is also evident from the following image
                        showing the (Python)-validation of a very long and awkward string fully
                        matching the pattern in MIRIAM:</p>
                    <p><img class="14cm-9cm" src="https://datasciencehub.net/system/files/img/arkValidpyMIRIAMpattern.JPG"
                            alt="Regex-test(Python) of MIRIAM-pattern for fake ARK." /></p>

                    <p>Similarly, the DOI-pattern registered at identifiers.org (as shown above,
                        under Review 4, point 5), does not prevent fake DOI:s from passing as valid.
                        I do not know who is "maintaining" these patterns in MIRIAM, if they are
                        only deposited as is, by the time of registration of a prefix in the
                        identifiers.org database by the responsible depositing agent, or if they are
                        actually managed and updated by <em>identifiers.org</em> staff. There is,
                        indeed, sometimes quite a large time span between <em>Date of creation</em>
                        and <em>Date of last modification</em> in MIRIAM for a <em>Data
                            collection</em> such as DOI, but it is not clear to me if modifications
                        made also involve these validation patterns. It would be an advantage to
                        record also <em>what</em> modifications were made and when, i.e. including a
                        record history, at least in the RDF/XML version. The thing with DOIs in
                        particular, as shown in the paper, is also that due to the initial lack of
                        pattern restrictions they differ so much from each other that it is
                        practically impossible to find a sufficiently restrictive pattern that does
                        not at the same time exclude many prevalent, resolvable DOIs from validating
                        OK, (as shown in the paper and above under Review 4, point 5, with
                        references to <a href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#fenner-2016"> </a> and <a href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#gilmartin-2015"

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Reviewer</strong>:<q> You refer to ordinary or plain URIs and
                            resolvable URIs. I recommend checking ‘Study on Persistent URIs’
                            (https://philarcher.org/diary/2013/uripersistence/), which provides
                            information on the persistent identifiers in the context of the Web
                            architecture. I recommend you follow the terminology defined there.
                            Another important reference is ‘Cool URI’s don’t change’
                            (https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI). </q></p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Response</strong>: It is not clear to me exactly what parts of the
                        terminology used here that should be followed, in particular since even
                        within this document itself and in the next recommended reference in the
                        Metareview it seems different terms for the same things are used, e.g. what
                        is the difference between an "ID string", an "item ID" and a "Local ID",
                        (for which I used the term 'objectId' in the paper)? I would be willing to
                        adopt any terms that were truly felt to represent a common global standard,
                        but in the documents referenced here there appears to be no such terms
                        easily discernible. The closest I get to is "local id", used - in different
                        forms - at least in two of the referenced documents, so I would be prepared
                        to use that instead of 'objectId' to comply, although I think the latter
                        better describes its place in the model proposed here.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Reviewer</strong>: <q>I also recommend you check the paper
                            “Identifiers for the 21st century: How to design, provision and reuse
                            persistent identifiers to maximize utility and impact of life science

                            of the authors). You suggest adding context to the identifiers - please
                            check Lesson 4 as well as the e.g. the OBO Foundry identifiers policy:
                            http://www.obofoundry.org/id-policy.html for resources explaining why
                            identifiers should be opaque. </q></p>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Response</strong>: I am grateful for these instructive and helpful
                        references, of which I was not aware before. However, I do not think they in
                        essence contradict anything that is said in the paper. I believe I have
                        answered some of the issues from Lesson 4 in <a href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#mcmurry_etal-2017"
                        > </a> regarding the preferable opaqueness of PIDs above in the responses to
                        Review 2 and 3. It was never my intention to rely on embedded meaning for
                        uniqueness in the local ID, in the model proposed corresponding to the
                        objectId, although I admit this might be the impression given by the example
                        given in section 7 of the paper. This has now been revised. I note at the
                        same time that Lesson 4 does allow for embedded meaning on some paticular
                        conditions: <q>Meaning should only be embedded if it is indisputable,
                            unchangeable and also useful to the data consumer (e.g.,
                            computer-processable). For instance, the type of entity imparts meaning
                            to users and may fulfil these 3 criteria. When encountered, typing may
                            be embedded, either within the local ID (ENSMUSG…), or within the http
                            URI path (…/gene/12345), or both.</q> But, it is not clear to me why in
                        Lesson 4 it is further stated, without giving a reason: <q>In any case, if
                            you opt to include type in the identifiers you issue, avoid relying on
                            type for uniqueness: that is to say, once a local ID (e.g., 12345) is
                            assigned it should never be recycled for another entity, even an entity
                            of a different type (e.g., …/gene/12345 and …/patient/12345).</q>
                        Nevertheless, I believe the proposed restricted character set in the model
                        should be wide enough to be sufficient for guaranteeing local uniqueness
                        within most namespaces, without resorting also to the object (or 'entity')
                        type module to differentiate between local ids. Alternatively, this might be
                        done by reserving certain characters in the local id (objectId) for specific
                        object types. Admittedly, though, the argument in Lesson 5 for not relying
                        on case for uniqueness appears to be compelling, which would reduce the
                        number of unique permutations to 34e10, using only either lower or upper
                        case characters. So, the model in the paper has been revised accordingly.
                        Hopefully, it will still be wide enough to allow for local uniqueness within
                        the namespace.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Reviewer</strong>: <q>While the paper aims at discussing identifiers
                            in the context of the FAIR principles, the principles themselves are
                            interpreted without referring to the different elements in their
                            definition (that you included in Figure 1). For example, when discussing
                            findability, you refer to ‘googling’ rather than analysing the actual
                            four elements described in the principle to be findable
                            (F1,F2,F3,F4).</q>
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Response</strong>: That is true, to the extent that the paper focuses
                        on what is believed to be missing in the definitions and explications of the
                        FAIR principles, e.g. for Findability, the <em>distribution</em>
                        (dissemination) and <em>use</em> of PIDs for citations, for example. True,
                        F4 could be interpreted as requiring at least open display of a PID as part
                        of the metadata, which might promote the use of PIDs for citation, but is
                        apparently not sufficient, judging from the case with <a
                            href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#vandesompel-2016a"> </a>, as indicated in the paper. To first
                        analyse the FAIR-principles in detail, before pointing out what is perceived
                        as missing, however, would have required more space than the 8000 words
                        allowance for a position paper. That said, I do for example stress the "sine
                        qua non" of <em>machine actionable</em> or <em>machine readable</em>
                        metadata, which is also used by <em>fairmetrics.org</em> as a measure of
                            Findability.<a href="ds-supplementary-558-853.html#FM_F2"> </a> Similarly, for Interoperability or
                        Re-usability, the focus is on being 'validatable', perceived as somewhat
                        neglected in the explication of FAIR, as argued above, but which also
                        requires metadata and PIDs in particular to be machine actionable.</p>

                            the arguments you make, where some conceptual elements are conflated and
                            or confused (see points above and Reviewers #4 points). Instead, I
                            recommend discussing strong conceptual points, which should be supported
                            by the examples, rather than the other way around. </q></p>

                        in scholarly communication, identify some of their shortcomings, trying to
                        find out how PIDs could be made more "FAIR", while explicating the FAIR
                        principles to include also distribution (dissemination) and
                        'validatability'. I have tried to respond to the points above and those of

                    <p><strong>Response</strong>: Last things first, the model is free to be used by
                        any namespace custodians willing to take on the responsibilities of minting
                        PIDs and maintaining a PID schema, within any scholarly discipline, STEM,
                        social sciences or humanities. So, while not prescribing or trying to impose
                        the model on any particular community, I believe it could be used by most
                        existing namespaces within scholarly communication today, and that, as
                        indicated in section 7, it could also be integrated with already existing
                        PID-schemas. The distinguishing features of this model are simply that it
                        makes the connection of object types (or resource types) with namespace
                        prefixes explicit, thereby adding semantic content to the PIDs, allowing
                        them to "identify themselves", and further the formal requirement of
                        'validatability' (by means of restrictions on string-length, and character
                        set, pattern recognition, possibly also checksum - depending on minting
                        algorithm used). It might be said that these features can already be found
                        in other already existing PID-models, e.g. in the IGSN, which I suggest
                        could easily be integrated with this model, in particular, since it
                        apparently has only one 'object type'. But, I do not find the importance of
                        having PIDs convey also semantic content by means of 'object types' strongly
                        emphasized in any other model, at least not in the other examples of PIDs
                        examined here. And the strong reaction by reviewers to this suggestion
                        indicates that it is not a regulart part of other PID models.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Reviewer</strong>:<q>Please, add a conclusion section summarising the
                            paper contributions.</q>
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Response</strong>: I have now added a short conclusion section. I
                        have also expanded some parts, to answer some of the calls from reviewers,
                        while other parts had to be removed to stay within the given limits of a
                        position paper. (Notably, the part about <em>signposting.org</em> and its
                        references were left out, but kept as "comments" in the RASH-html, as part
                        of the "record history" of the revised paper.)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Reviewer</strong>: <q>Please, also revise the text (e.g. there are
                            typos such as ‘homonymi’ instead of homonymy).</q></p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Response</strong>: I have revised and partly compressed the text,
                        correcting typos found, thank you for bringing it to my attention. I also
                        revised and corrected the original Schematron schema code example, which was
                        in fact not well-formed before. (Surprisingly, though, no reviewer made any mention of that.)</p>
